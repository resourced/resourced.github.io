# Collecting Log Lines from Files

ResourceD agent can be configured to collect log lines from files.

Make sure you install ResourceD agent on every host and enable loggers of your choice via `loggers/*.toml` config files.

Feel free to take a look at [this link for help](//github.com/resourced/resourced/tree/master/tests/resourced-configs/loggers). These examples are well documented.
